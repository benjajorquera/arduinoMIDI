# arduinoMIDI

This device allows musicians and producers to interact seamlessly with both digital and analog synthesizers. With MIDI capabilities, it enables precise control over various parameters like pitch, modulation, and velocity, translating these into CV outputs compatible with modular synths and other analog gear. Using Arduino, this project is highly customizable, offering flexibility for users to tailor the controller to specific workflows and preferences, making it a powerful tool for creating unique, expressive sounds across different audio environments.
